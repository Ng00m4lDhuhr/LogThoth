# This module is supposed to handle the loading of logs
# This module should not concern itself with serailizing 
# The core purpose of the module is to minimize memory usage
# by dynamically loading needed logs objects to memory when required
# and unloading it on a binary file in a tmp folder with prespecified format
# the hows are not the concern but the whens are.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # lol there is nothing to do
    pass
