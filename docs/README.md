# Documentation

## Documentation Principles
* clear != simple

  word should be very descriptive of what you are saying, we cannot afford to leave anything to the imagination of the reader.
* Dependency > Complexity

  if some concept is too complex to explain, it would be better to just link to another article/video/documentation that does it better that you would
* Nothing is True

  This principles are guidelines that are to be broken if life demands it, just get it [done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus&pp=ygUQdGhlIGN1bHQgb2YgZG9uZQ%3D%3D) before deadline, we can do it better next time.
