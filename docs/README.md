## Writing Principles
Things to consider when writing the documentation 

### Clearity Over Simplicity
words should be very descriptive of what you are saying, we cannot afford to leave anything to the imagination of the reader.

### Dependency Over Complexity
if some concept is too complex to explain, it would be better to just link to another article/video/documentation that does it better than you would
  
### Nothing is True
These principles are guidelines that are to be broken if life demands it, just get it [done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus&pp=ygUQdGhlIGN1bHQgb2YgZG9uZQ%3D%3D), we can do it better next time.
